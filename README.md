# EHealthcare_Project

🏥 E-Healthcare Management System
The E-Healthcare Management System is a full-stack web application developed using Spring Boot (Java) for the backend and Angular for the frontend, integrated with an Oracle Database.
This project provides a robust, efficient way to manage hospital operations, patients, services, and staff through clearly separated Admin and Client modules.

🔍 Overview
This system is designed to streamline hospital operations, reduce manual errors, and improve service delivery. It uses modern technologies and follows real-world healthcare data flows to simulate a practical hospital management environment.

🎯 Objectives
Build a fully working healthcare system using Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and Oracle DB.
Implement real-time modules like department setup, doctor availability, room bookings, test reports, and online payments.
Use RESTful APIs to connect frontend and backend.
Structure the application based on best practices (CRISP-DM, component-based frontend, schema-driven backend).
